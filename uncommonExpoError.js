This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or module within Expo that isn't compatible with your current setup or environment.  It often stems from inconsistencies between the Expo SDK version, the required native modules, and the device or emulator you're using.  The vague message doesn't directly point to the problem's root cause, making debugging challenging.  You might see this error after upgrading Expo, installing new packages, or changing device configurations.
